Patterns are a special syntax in Rust for matching against the structure of
types, both complex and simple. Using patterns in conjunction with match

control flow. A pattern consists of some combination of the following:

Literals
Destructured arrays, enums, structs, or tuples
Variables
Wildcards
Placeholders
