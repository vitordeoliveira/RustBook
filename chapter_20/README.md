# Final Project: Building a Multithreaded Web Server

Here is our plan for building the web server:

1. Learn a bit about TCP and HTTP.
1. Listen for TCP connections on a socket.
1. Parse a small number of HTTP requests.
1. Create a proper HTTP response.
1. Improve the throughput of our server with a thread pool.
