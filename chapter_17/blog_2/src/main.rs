/// The changes we needed to make to main to reassign post mean that this implementation doesnâ€™t

/// are no longer encapsulated entirely within the Post implementation. However, our gain is that
/// invalid states are now impossible because of the type system and the type checking that happens
/// at compile time! This ensures that certain bugs, such as display of the content of an
/// unpublished post, will be discovered before they make it to production.
