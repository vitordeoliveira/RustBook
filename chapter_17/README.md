# Object-Oriented Programming Features of Rust

In this chapter, we’ll explore certain characteristics that are commonly
considered object-oriented and how those characteristics translate to idiomatic
Rust. We’ll then show you how to implement an object-oriented design pattern in
Rust and discuss the trade-offs of doing so versus implementing a solution
using some of Rust’s strengths instead.
